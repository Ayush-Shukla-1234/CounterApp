Android Counter App 🔢

A functional Android application developed as part of my mobile development journey.
Technical Highlights:

    State Management: Uses a Java variable to track and update the count in real-time.

    Event Handling: Implements View.OnClickListener to respond to user input.

    Dynamic UI: Updates TextView content dynamically using setText().
